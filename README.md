## **Key Metrics**

### **1. Global Covid-19 Statistics**  
- **Total Cases**: 321M  
- **Total Tests**: 2.2bn  
- **Case Fatality Rate**: 2.22%  
- **Total Deaths**: 7.12M  
- **Total Vaccinations**: 2.7bn  
- **Total People Vaccinated**: 1.4bn  

These KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) summarize the overall spread, testing, and response to the pandemic.

## **Visualizations**

### **2. Total Cases by Location**  
- **Regional Distribution**:  
   - Europe and North America lead with the highest total cases, followed closely by South America and Asia.  
   - Countries like **India** and **the United States** are prominently represented as significant contributors to the total cases.  

### **3. Testing and Cases Distribution**  
- **Total Cases by Location**:  
   - The map highlights the **global distribution** of Covid-19 cases with bubble sizes proportional to the total cases in each region.  
   - Major clusters are evident in **North America** and **Europe**, reflecting high case concentrations.  
   - Smaller bubbles across **Asia**, **Africa**, and **South America** indicate varying case volumes across these regions.  
   - **Australia** shows relatively fewer cases, with smaller bubble sizes.  
- The map effectively illustrates **geographical hotspots** of the pandemic and their global spread.

### **4. New Cases and Testing Trends**  
- **New Cases Per Day** vs. **New Tests Per Day**:  
   - A clear upward trend in new cases and testing is visible between **2020 and 2021**, with peak testing rates observed towards the end of the timeline.  
   - This visualization helps analyze the effectiveness of testing relative to case detection.

---

### **5. Case Fatality Rate by Location**  
- Countries like **Vanuatu**, **Yemen**, and **Mexico** report higher case fatality rates, indicating challenges in healthcare systems or delays in treatment.

---

### **6. Case Fatality Rate (%) and Positivity Rate (%) by Date**  
- A time-based analysis of fatality and positivity rates reveals spikes during significant waves of the pandemic.  
- **Positivity Rate**: Measures the percentage of positive tests over total tests conducted, offering insights into testing adequacy during peak times.

---

## Insights and Analysis

1. **Global Spread**: Europe and North America emerge as primary regions with the highest total cases, while other regions also contribute significant case volumes.  
2. **Testing and Detection**: Increased testing over time correlates with improved case detection, yet positivity rates highlight gaps during peak waves.  
3. **Case Fatality Variations**: Fatality rates vary across locations, suggesting disparities in healthcare infrastructure and response effectiveness.  
4. **Vaccinations and Recovery**: Vaccination programs reflect progress in combating the pandemic, with a large percentage of the population vaccinated globally.
